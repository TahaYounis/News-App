# News-App
This application fetches and displays news from the server. You can also search for specific news and save the news to read it without bringing it again via the Internet

## Libraries and technologies used

• Navigation component : one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activites.

• Retrofit: for fetch data from Api.

• Room: save data and delete data on mobile, for using it when no connection.

• MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.

• Coroutines : do some code in the background.

• view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.

• Glide : Catch images and load them in imageView.
